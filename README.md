# PURPOSE
This project is used to on simulating MANETs (mobile wireless adhoc networks).

# INTRODUCTION 
The network utilizes a number of fixed nodes called anchors. Each network topology
file has one, or more, anchor node(s). An anchor node corresponds to a node of type host or
accesspoint in cnet. An anchor node serves two purposes. An anchor node can store data
packets intended for delivery to mobile nodes and it periodically broadcasts a
beacon message that informs mobile nodes about its existence (and availability for help). A beacon
message may contain useful information such as the coordinates of the anchor node and/or
a list of destination addresses of packets currently stored in the anchor node waiting for delivery.
